## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed `mod.Mod.Register` and `mod.Mod.Data` usage for Hades 2 update.

## [4.0.0] - 2024-06-03

### Added

- Added `once_loaded` with fields `mod`, `game`, and `save` (replaces the `on_ready_*` fields).

### Changed

- `ModUtil.Mod.Data` will now produce an error when accessed before the game has loaded a save.

### Fixed

- Fixed `table` in the game globals so it is now properly extended (was broken by `3.1.2`).
- As a result of changes in `SGG_Modding-ENVY` and this plugin, `ModUtil.Mod.Data` now properly affects `ModData`.

### Deprecated

- `on_ready_early` now behaves like `on_ready_late`.
- `on_ready_early`, `on_ready_late`, `on_ready_final` have all been renamed.

## [3.1.2] - 2024-05-29

### Fixed

- Fixed `table.concat`, and `table` changes no longer affect plugins.

## [3.1.1] - 2024-05-16

### Fixed

- Fixed mod-specific save data (ModData) not being retained in the save.

## [3.1.0] - 2024-05-15

### Added

- Added a callback to wait for the end of all game scripts (easier to remember than explicitly queueing onto `RoomLogic.lua`)

### Changed

- Changed the structure of the definitions files, now `modutil.mod` has some hints (still a work in progress).

### Fixed

- Fixed `ModUtil.Hades.PrintStack`, as it would read the config incorrectly and try to use a since deleted internal table.

## [3.0.0] - 2024-05-15

### Added

- Added interface as a ReturnOfModding plugin, with helpers to manage loading (e.g. on_ready_early)

### Changed

- Moved ModUtil.Mod.Register and ModData to ModUtil.lua so it will be available earlier in the load order
- Moved ModUtil.Hades.PrintStack config to dedicated module wide config
- Moved to ReturnOfModding layout (still works on ModImporter)

### Removed

- Removed all menu handling capabilities from ModUtil.Hades
- Removed ModUtil.Compat, which includes the old names, such as WrapBaseFunction

## [2.10.1] - 2024-04-24

### Added

- Initial Thunderstore release.
